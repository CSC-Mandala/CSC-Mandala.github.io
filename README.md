# Mandala Workshop

Mandala is a platform of interconnected digital applications that supports you in creating, managing, and sharing diverse scholarly content for research and learning. It was developed by SHANTI, now integrated into the Contemplative Sciences Center (CSC), is funded by the Vice President for Information Technology, and will be supported by UVA Library. Currently, is is only available to UVA faculty, staff, and students. 

Mandala manages content via collections and subcollections which house assets of a single media type (Text, Image, AV, Visual, or bibliographic Source).

In this workshop, you will learn about Mandala's Texts tool and how it can be used to create Open Educational Resources (OERs) for and with your students. Participants will collaboratively create a Texts collection using Public Domain materials to explore the features and functionality of the tool.
